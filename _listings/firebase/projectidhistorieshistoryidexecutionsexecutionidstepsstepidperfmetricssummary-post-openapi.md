      summary: Create Releases
      description: |-
        Create a `Release`.

        Release names should reflect the developer's deployment practices. For
        example, the release name may include the environment name, application
        name, application version, or any other name meaningful to the developer.
        Once a `Release` refers to a `Ruleset`, the rules can be enforced by
        Firebase Rules-enabled services.

        More than one `Release` may be 'live' concurrently. Consider the following
        three `Release` names for `projects/foo` and the `Ruleset` to which they
        refer.

        Release Name                    | Ruleset Name
        --------------------------------|-------------
        projects/foo/releases/prod      | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
        projects/foo/releases/prod/beta | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
        projects/foo/releases/prod/v23  | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid456

        The table reflects the `Ruleset` rollout in progress. The `prod` and
        `prod/beta` releases refer to the same `Ruleset`. However, `prod/v23`
        refers to a new `Ruleset`. The `Ruleset` reference for a `Release` may be
        updated using the UpdateRelease method, and the custom `Release` name
        may be referenced by specifying the `X-Firebase-Rules-Release-Name` header.

        Test `Source` for syntactic and semantic correctness. Issues present in the
        rules, if any, will be returned to the caller with a description, severity,
        and source location.

        The test method will typically be executed with a developer provided
        `Source`, but if regression testing is desired, this method may be
        executed against a `Ruleset` resource name and the `Source` will be
        retrieved from the persisted `Ruleset`.

        The following is an example of `Source` that permits users to upload images
        to a bucket bearing their user id and matching the correct metadata:

        _*Example*_

            // Users are allowed to subscribe and unsubscribe to the blog.
            service firebase.storage {
