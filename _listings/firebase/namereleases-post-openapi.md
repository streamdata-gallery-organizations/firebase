  title: Firebase Rules Post Name Releases
  description: |-
    Create a `Release`.

    Release names should reflect the developer's deployment practices. For
    example, the release name may include the environment name, application
    name, application version, or any other name meaningful to the developer.
    Once a `Release` refers to a `Ruleset`, the rules can be enforced by
    Firebase Rules-enabled services.

    More than one `Release` may be 'live' concurrently. Consider the following
    three `Release` names for `projects/foo` and the `Ruleset` to which they
    refer.

    Release Name                    | Ruleset Name
    --------------------------------|-------------
    projects/foo/releases/prod      | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
    projects/foo/releases/prod/beta | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid123
    projects/foo/releases/prod/v23  | projects/foo/rulesets/uuid456

    The table reflects the `Ruleset` rollout in progress. The `prod` and
    `prod/beta` releases refer to the same `Ruleset`. However, `prod/v23`
    refers to a new `Ruleset`. The `Ruleset` reference for a `Release` may be
    updated using the UpdateRelease method.
